This is actually not an input method, but provides documents,
default values of global variables, and default key-bindings of
global commands."))

(variable
 (candidates-group-size

Value must be an integer.
If the value is not positive, number of candidates in a group is decided
by how candiates are grouped in an input method source file.")

 (candidates-charset
  (_"Character set to limit candidates.
Value must be a symbol representing a charater set, or nil.
If the value is not nil, a candidate containing a character not belonging
to the specified character set is ignored.")
  nil)

 (fallback-input-method
  (_"Fallback input methods.
Value must be comma separated fallback input method names.
When you type a key that is not handled by the currently activated intup method,
fallback input methods (in the order specified in this variable) try
to handle that key, and the first one that can handle the key is activated
temporarily.
For instance, as the default value of this variable is \"lsymbol, unicode\",
when you type \"/...\" while you are activating an input method
that doesn't handle that key sequence, \"lsymbol\" input method is activated
and \"â€¦\" (U+2026: HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS) is inserted.")
